# Political-Social-Media-Analysis

This dataset, from Crowdflower's Data For Everyone Library, provides text of 5000 messages from politicians' social media accounts, along with human judgments about the purpose, partisanship, and audience of the messages.

How was it collected?
Contributors looked at thousands of social media messages from US Senators and other American politicians to classify their content. Messages were broken down into audience (national or the tweeterâ€™s constituency), bias (neutral/bipartisan, or biased/partisan), and finally tagged as the actual substance of the message itself (options ranged from informational, announcement of a media appearance, an attack on another candidate, etc.)

Acknowledgments
Data was provided by the Data For Everyone Library on Crowdflower.

Our Data for Everyone library is a collection of our favorite open data jobs that have come through our platform. They're available free of charge for the community, forever.

Inspiration
Here are a couple of questions you can explore with this dataset:

what words predict partisan v. neutral messages?
what words predict support messages v. attack messages?
do politicians use Twitter and Facebook for different purposes? (e.g., Twitter for attack messages, Facebook for policy messages)?
